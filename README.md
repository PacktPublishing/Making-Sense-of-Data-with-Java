# Making Sense of Data with Java [Video]
This is the code repository for [Making Sense of Data with Java [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/making-sense-data-java-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788396288), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Data Analysis is the process of evaluating data using analytical and logical reasoning to examine each component of the data provided. Effective data analysis is about transferring data through three main states: data, information, and knowledge. This matters because people become overwhelmed by large amounts of data. But, don't fret, this video course will be your companion and show you how to model and visualize your data efficiently with Java in a jiffy. 
This video course starts by showing you how to obtain, understand, and evaluate the text. Youâ€™ll look at different files and see how to apply analysis techniques, so your software programs can make sense of information to gain valuable insights. Youâ€™ll also learn to use Java tools to visualize data in various forms. Finally, you will be walked through the different methods to analyze text, big data, and other types of multimedia such as image analysis, facial analysis, and pattern recognition.
